# MeteobridgeTools
Some SQL scripts and documentation to get started with external database logging of Meteobridge data

## Credits
The scripts and documentation I wrote in this repository are heavely based on [this blogpost written by Steve Jenkins](https://web.archive.org/web/20210412203413/https://gist.github.com/stevejenkins?page=2). Unfortunately this article is gone from the world wide web and only readable via the Internet Archive. To help preserving it I decided to create this repository with some helper scripts and documentation.
